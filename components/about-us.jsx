                    <p> T-Hands is an emerging organization formed and maintained by a bunch of batch mates of John Memorial High School Sasthamcotta (2007-2013) batch. In today's hectic world social responsibility is something we are ignorant of.
                        <br/> <br/>
                        T-hands is our Own creation to bring changes in the system by reminding their duties and responsibilities towards the society.
                        <br/> <br/>
                        To make our life better, we consciously forget our humanity. Just helping others are not enough... We can do a lot to bring satisfaction to the lives of others.
